Decryption Result of the Encrypted Text:
The quick brown fox jump over the lazy dog.

### Features:

- Core Encryption Algorithm: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard or Rijndael)
- Password Hashing Algorithm: SHA512
- Able to encrypt most of the languages in the world.
- Light weight, efficient, protable (no installation needed).
- Able to be encrypted with up to 4 combination of passwords.
- Text is compressed. Encrypted text is shorten.
